# ✨ intro
Heyya, I'm Adrian ✂️! A 23 years old vibe coding enthusiast that loves sharting my trash-ass ideas into LLMs that have zero sense of proper coding.
I live in Germany near Dortmund and my favorite activities are either coding, fapping, binge-watching, mistreating my partner or eating trash from the supermarket.


## 🔎 taking a deeper look

When someone says something mean to me or just about me, my over-protective girlfriend (that loves my shroom-dick real good hmmm) tries to protect me to get even more dick. Please don't be so upset about her, I manipulated her into that behaviour :3  
I'm a bit shy, so you won't see that very much on my github profile, but I'll try my best ^w^  
When I'm alone, I love spiraling in my own misery instead of trying to do better. Please safe me from my miserable state, I cannot live on my own. 😭  
My alcoholism helps me drown into my dread more precisely and I hurt others with my behaviour by making false-promises and not trying to work on myself and lying to myself and others. 🍺  
I break trust very frequently and love to jump into rivers for money 🌊⚓. My girlfriend kicked me out when i was unable to find a job because I didn't even try. :(  
I started 4 different apprenticeships but had "too bad mental health 🤒" to continue any of these. Getting myself help was never an option. ❌

## 📋🚩 my experiences
- ❌ Reverse engineering: No experience at all, but still a larp 🌷
- ❌ Coding experience: 6 years of Java - time flies fast, almost feels like I leanred nothing ⏰
- ✅ High skilled social manipulator: my girlfriend now follows me everywhere, even on the streets into homelessness 🏠
- ✅ Narcissistic and always prioritize my well-being over others, neither realizing nor caring how this affects my social cues 👍
- ✅ Gas-lighting: a very useful and self-destructive technique my abusive parents taught me, I never got rid of 😭
- ✅ Jumping into rivers for money 🌊💸
- ✅ Jobless for 5+ years living with my toxic parents 👪
- ✅ Highly experienced in marketing my low coding skills to people on the internet, but not to my employer ♥️

## 🌷 my ongoing projects
- ✨ fixing my life (long term goal, but not high priority tbh)
- 👪 going back to my parents place and deleting 🚒 myself (again) from the internet because i think that everybody hates me 😥
- 💕 abusing my girlfriend even more, trying to emphasize with her again to stay at her place again to get kicked out again from her dad 😡

# 💣 conclusion
Feels like I achieved nothing in my life, thank god. ✨🙏⛪
